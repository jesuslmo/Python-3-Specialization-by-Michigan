MAP
You previously were introduced to accumulating a list by transforming each of the elements. Here we revisit that pattern.
The following function produces a new list with each item in the original list doubled.
It is an example of a mapping, from the original list to a new list of the same length, where each element is doubled.
"""

def doubleStuff(a_list):
    """ Return a new list in which contains doubles of the elements in a_list. """
    new_list = []
    for value in a_list:
        new_elem = 2 * value
        new_list.append(new_elem)
    return new_list

things = [2, 5, 9]
print(things)
things = doubleStuff(things)
print(things)


"""
As we did when passing a function as a parameter to the sorted function, we can specify a function to pass to map either
by referring to a function by name, or by providing a lambda expression.
